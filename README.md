# Speed Typing Test

The Speed Typing Test is a Python program that allows users to test their typing speed by typing a given text as quickly as possible. The program provides real-time feedback on the user's typing speed in words per minute (WPM).

- Displays a welcome screen and waits for a key press to start the test.
- Calculates the user's typing speed in WPM based on the time taken to complete the test.
- Supports backspace/delete functionality for correcting errors during typing.
- Allows users to repeat the test multiple times.
